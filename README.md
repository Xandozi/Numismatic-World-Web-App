Hello! This is my project for a numismatic web app that focuses on a user login/register on the website and choose whatever coins exist on the website database to their own collection. It also lets you export your collection via PDF file. 
You can expect the standard actions regarding user account management. Also a facilitated way to search coins so you do not have to be roaming around 10 pages of coins with 15 coins each page.

Any kind of improvement you have you can pull and commit and will be further evaluated and merged if aplicable.

Thank you and enjoy!
